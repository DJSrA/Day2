				Mason Stewart is an interesting individual.

				<p>
					I dont know if there is a better descriptive than "interesting". A man of few desires, a simple life and immense goals. His teaching style is conversational-easy-going and it's refreshing he doesn't take himself to seriously. His hobbies appear to be: Beer, Food, Sleep, Coding, and public derision of Marco Suarez.

					The Iron yard advertised this course to start at the beginning (no coding experience necessary) and build us into Junior developers within 13 weeks. Today being the first day, we started out easy. We are only expected to have a working knowledge of CSS and HTML after 3 hours of lecture half of which was spent learning keyboard shortcuts, downloading necessary software and "Big Picture" familiarization. So that means CSS and HTML in 1.5 hrs.... Yeah, that's starting at the beginning. Mason has promised tomorrow we will actually have a demanding day. Sounds like fun.
				</p>

				<p>
					Seriously though, I am looking forward to being challenged and pushed. I will be a sponge so help me.
